\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Defines a D\+M\+X512 fixture object. 

Fixtures are machines daisy chained together to form a D\+M\+X512 universe. Each fixture is addressed over a range of up to 512 addresses. A fixture\textquotesingle{}s channel count defines its address footprint in a D\+M\+X512 universe and fixture addresses and hannels may not overlap one into another.
