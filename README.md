# Motivation

Part of ASLS (Autonomous Stage Lighting Systems) development, it was originally created to offer new simple ways to synchronize the many aspects of complex lightshows (Stage lighting, pyrotechnics, medai servers...). Following the end of the project, it was decided to release the project as an open-source, free to use platform for anyone to enjoy.
