# cueOS

cueOS is an ARM Operating System dedicated to provide new solutions for Show Control. Based around ASLS' "Q solutions" it aims to ease synchronisation of various elements of a sound and light show such as intelligent stage equipment, pyrotechnics and many others through the use of a single UDP Show Control protocol "Q".
